# Let'sUpgrade Python Boot Camp: Introduction to Python Programming and Assignments

### About :
Let'sUpgrade is organizing a free boot camp consisting of a 3-day program aimed at introducing participants to Python programming. This boot camp provides an opportunity to learn and practice various assignments that cover the fundamentals of Python.

During the boot camp, participants will engage in hands-on exercises and assignments that help apply Python programming knowledge. These assignments cover a wide range of topics, allowing participants to explore and gain expertise in the basics of Python.

By participating in this boot camp and completing the assignments, individuals can enhance their understanding of Python programming and build a strong foundation in the language.

Participants can refer to the assignments to get started and maximize this valuable learning opportunity.
### Create a Calculator - Project Given By LetsUpgrade :

Problem Statement: Create a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user. The program should provide a menu of operations for the user to choose from and display the result based on the selected operation. The program should include the following functionalities:

Addition: Add two numbers and display the sum.
Subtraction: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number and display the result.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers and display the product.
Division: Perform division on two numbers and display the result in decimal form and as an integer quotient.
Modulus: Calculate the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number and display the result.
Exit: Terminate the program.
The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and their choice of operation. Based on the chosen operation, the program should perform the calculation and display the result accordingly. The program should terminate if the user selects the "Exit" option.

Note: The program assumes that the user will enter valid integer values for the numbers and make appropriate choices from the menu.
